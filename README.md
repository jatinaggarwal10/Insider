# Insider
<br>
This project aims to write automated test cases on insider.in website using Cypress - https://www.cypress.io/ . Paytm Insider aims to give you experiences in Mumbai worth your time and money, and hopefully, encourage you to try something new.  

# System Requirements 
<br>
Cypress is a desktop application that is installed on your computer. The desktop application supports these operating systems:<br>
•	macOS 10.9 and above (64-bit only)<br>
•	Linux Ubuntu 12.04 and above, Fedora 21 and Debian 8 (64-bit only)<br>
•	Windows 7 and above
<br>

# Installing
<br>
•	All the code required to get started<br>
•	Images of what it should look like<br>

  # Clone
  <br>
  •	Clone this repo to your local machine using- https://github.com/jatinaggarwal10/Insider.git <br>
  
  # SetUp
  <br>
  •	Install npm through this link - https://nodejs.org/en/download/ <br>
  •	Set Environment variables <br>
     Give the knowledge npm to your system  just by adding external paths into it.<br>
   •	Installing Cypress via npm is easy:<br>
   cd /your/project/path<br>
   npm install cypress --save-dev<br>
   This will install Cypress locally as a dev dependency for your project.
Make sure that you have already run npm init or have a node_modules folder or package.json file in the root of your project to ensure cypress is installed in the correct directory.<br>

# Opening Cypress
<br>
If you used npm to install, Cypress has now been installed to your ./node_modules directory, with its binary executable accessible from ./node_modules/.bin.
Now you can open Cypress from your project root one of the following ways:
The long way with the full path
<br>

./node_modules/.bin/cypress open<br>

Or with the shortcut using npm bin<>br
$(npm bin)/cypress open<br>

# Add a test file<br>
Let’s create a new file in the cypress/integration folder that was created for us:

touch {your_project}/cypress/integration/sample_spec.js<br>
<br>
Once we’ve created that file, we should see the Cypress Test Runner immediately display it in the list of Integration Tests. Cypress monitors your spec files for any changes and automatically displays any changes.<br>

# Running the tests
<br>
Open Cypress folder <br>
Open Integration Folder<br>
and click on Assignment.js  file<br>
